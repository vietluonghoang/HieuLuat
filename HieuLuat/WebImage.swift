    /*
     The image view's content mode is Aspect Fit.

     My problem is the same as the one stated in this post. Inside my prototype TableViewCell's ContentView, I have a vertical StackView constrained to each edge. Inside the StackView there was a Label, ImageView and another Label. Having the ImageView set to AspectFit was not enough. The image would be the proper size and proportions but the ImageView didn't wrap the actual image leaving a bunch of extra space between the image and label (just like in the image above). The ImageView height seemed to match height of the original image rather than the height of the resized image (after aspectFit did it's job). Other solutions I found didn't completely resolve the problem for various reasons. I hope this helps someone.

            let myImageHeight = myImage.size.height
            let myViewWidth = self.frame.size.width

            let ratio = myViewWidth/myImageWidth
            let scaledHeight = myImageHeight * ratio

            return CGSize(width: myViewWidth, height: scaledHeight)
        }

        return CGSize(width: -1.0, height: -1.0)
    }
}
